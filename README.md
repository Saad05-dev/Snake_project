## Snake_project

 Generic snake game 

 Keyboard use only

 Movement == Arrows || QZSD

 Each time the snake eats the fruit the snake grows

 if snake gounds out of windows bound it pops back through the opposite side

 Snake move on it's own just and waits to specify direction no need to hold key

 can't make a 180Â° move eg:"if the snake's direction is facing right you can't go left you have only 2 options to go Up or Down"

 at some point if you eat enough fruits the snake will grow will be able to circle around itself and hitting it's body which causes the game to end "do not hit yourself"

 there is score points to keep track of how many fruits you ate
